# COVID-19 Anki deck
An [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck for COVID-19 information for the general public.

# Goals

I hope this compilation of information can help more of us to develop basic fluency regarding the pandemic, to spot fake rumours, to have a collection of reliable sources, to know why we're taking the measures we're advised to take, and in general to better take care of ourselves and our loved ones.
If you want to quickly check out the content in a (more) readable way, head to [the clone I'm maintaining on quizlet](https://quizlet.com/_87ozfq?x=1qqt&i=11csyy).

# How to use
1. Install [Anki Desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Install [the CrowdAnki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) and restart Anki Desktop.
3. From Anki Desktop `select File -> CrowdAnki: Import from git repository`. Enter *https://github.com/evolverine/covid-19-anki-deck* in the dialog that appears and click `OK`. The COVID-19 deck should appear, and you can start studying it.

Note that the viruses background only appears if the card is tagged with the "covid-19" tag.

# How to keep up to date with changes and additions
Repeat step 3 above, ideally on a weekly basis.
The one limitation is that if a note is removed in this deck this won't be reflected in your personal deck. But we will try to keep this in mind and, when necessary, change the content of notes instead of deleting them.

# How to contribute
There are two ways: through git or through opening an issue on github.

## 1. Through `git`
Some basic knowledge of `git` is necessary for this. (If you don't know what `git` is, best to use the second method, below.) 

First, make any change to the deck you see fit. Then, from AnkiDesktop select File -> Export. In the dialog that appears select *CrowdAnki JSON representation (*directory)* in the "Export format" drop-down, and then the COVID-19 deck in the "Include" drop-down. Leave "Include media" and "Include tags" checked. Click on *Export...* and select the directory where you cloned this repository. Then...

## 2. Through github issues
Navigate to [this repository's issue list](https://github.com/evolverine/covid-19-anki-deck/issues) and click the "New issue" button. In that issue describe as clearly as possible what you would like changed or added to the deck.

# Contributing
See [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to join the effort to make this a great resource.

# Disclaimer
I'm definitely not claiming that the contents of this deck represent the latest or most accurate information regarding COVID-19. I'm doing my best, but I am not a professional, nor can I focus on this full time. Which is also why I very much appreciate contributions from those of you with better or more up-to-date information.
