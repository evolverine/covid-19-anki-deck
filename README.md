# covid-19-anki-deck
An Anki deck for COVID-19 information for the general public. I hope this compilation of information can help more of us to develop basic fluency regarding the pandemic, to spot fake rumours, to have a collection of reliable sources, to know why we're taking the measures we're advised to take, and in general to better take care of ourselves and our loved ones.
If you want to quickly check out the content in a readable way, head to [the clone I'm maintaining on quizlet](https://quizlet.com/_87ozfq?x=1qqt&i=11csyy).

# How to use
1. Install [Anki Desktop](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
2. Install [the CrowdAnki add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778) and restart Anki Desktop.
3. From Anki Desktop `select File -> CrowdAnki: Import from Github`. Enter *evolverine/covid-19-anki-deck* in the dialog that appears and click `OK`. The COVID-19 deck should appear, and you can start studying it.

# How to keep up to date with changes and additions
Repeat step 3 above, ideally on a daily basis.
The one limitation is that if a note is removed in this deck this won't be reflected in your personal deck. But we will try to keep this in mind and, when necessary, change the content of notes instead of deleting them.

# How to contribute
There are two ways: through git or through opening an issue on github.

## 1. Through `git`
Some basic knowledge of `git` is necessary for this. (If you don't know what `git` is, best to use the second method, below.) 

First, make any change to the deck you see fit. Then, from AnkiDesktop select File -> Export. In the dialog that appears select *CrowdAnki JSON representation (*directory)* in the "Export format" drop-down, and then the COVID-19 deck in the "Include" drop-down. Leave "Include media" and "Include tags" checked. Click on *Export...* and select the directory where you cloned this repository. Then...

## 2. Through github issues
Navigate to [this repository's issue list](https://github.com/evolverine/covid-19-anki-deck/issues) and click the "New issue" button. In that issue describe as clearly as possible what you would like changed or added to the deck.

# Editorial considerations

* knowledge is welcome that can help reach the goals of this deck (see above)
* this is meant to be a global resource, so overly-specific local content isn't meant here
* essential that the information come from reputable sources
* useful to become familiar with [the guidelines for formulating knowledge for flash cards](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules), but we can work together at structuring the knowledge for flash cards
